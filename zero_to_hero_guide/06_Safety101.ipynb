    "\n",
    "Prompt Guard is a classifier model trained on a large corpus of attacks, which is capable of detecting both explicitly malicious prompts (Jailbreaks) as well as prompts that contain injected inputs (Prompt Injections). We suggest a methodology of fine-tuning the model to application-specific data to achieve optimal results.\n",
    "\n",
    "PromptGuard is a BERT model that outputs only labels; unlike Llama Guard, it doesn't need a specific prompt structure or configuration. The input is a string that the model labels as safe or unsafe (at two different levels).\n",

    "For more detail on PromptGuard, please checkout [PromptGuard model card and prompt formats](https://www.llama.com/docs/model-cards-and-prompt-formats/prompt-guard)\n",

    "**Llama Guard 3**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Llama Guard 3 comes in three flavors now: Llama Guard 3 1B, Llama Guard 3 8B and Llama Guard 3 11B-Vision. The first two models are text only, and the third supports the same vision understanding capabilities as the base Llama 3.2 11B-Vision model. All the models are multilingual–for text-only prompts–and follow the categories defined by the ML Commons consortium. Check their respective model cards for additional details on each model and its performance.\n",
