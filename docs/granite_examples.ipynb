    "Setup instructions:\n",
    "1. Install a fork of Llama Stack with Granite support\n",
    "1. Install the latest version of the `llama_stack_client` package using `pip`\n",
    "1. Download the `Llama3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct` Llama model (using the \"llama\" command) and the `granite-3.0-8b-instruct-r241014a` \n",
    "1. Configure a Llama Stack server with the `meta-reference` inference implementation serving the `Llama3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct` model\n",
    "1. Add a `remote::granite` inference provider to your copy of Llama stack. You can configure this provider during the manual, step-by-step configuration, or you can just change the part of your server's YAML configuration file that reads:\n",
    "    ```\n",
